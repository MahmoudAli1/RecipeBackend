# backend_v1

## Setup

1. Go to project folder

> cd backend_v1

2. Install Dependencies

> npm install

## Run

1. Start Server

2. Open in url or using an Endpoint tester (postman)

Listing the cart items endpoint 
> http://127.0.0.1:3000/   

Getting the recipe from the items endpoint
> http://127.0.0.1:3000/recipe

This part should be included with the frontend but due to lack of time and prior experience of reaction commerce framework I couldn't have time to continue.
